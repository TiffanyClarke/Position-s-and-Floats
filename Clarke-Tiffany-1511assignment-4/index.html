				<h2>Getting Started</h2>
				<p>There are three separate activities to work one. One is for <a href="positioning.html">positioning</a>, another is for <a href="floating.html">floating</a>, and the last is for building layout <a href="columns.html">Columns</a>.</p>

				<p>A few notes about this assignment:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>As always, carefully read all the instructions and the rubric for the assignment in Brightspace. How can you get awesome marks if you don't know what I'm grading for?!</li>
					<li>Do not put any code in the styles.css external stylesheet. Instead, apply CSS to the code block on the appropriate page. If you are working on floating.php, add CSS code ONLY to the &lt;style&gt; code block in the head of floating.php - failure to follow this rule will result in an <strong>INSTANT FAIL</strong> of the entire assignment!</li>
					<li>When you are done, please zip and re-submit this entire working folder.</li>
					<li>I <strong>HIGHLY</strong> recommend doing your required readings. These are important basic skills that you <em>must</em> understand before moving forward.</li>
